# Refactoring

You've been asked to refactor the function `deterministicPartitionKey` in [`dpk.js`](dpk.js) to make it easier to read and understand without changing its functionality. For this task, you should:

1. Write unit tests to cover the existing functionality and ensure that your refactor doesn't break it. We typically use `jest`, but if you have another library you prefer, feel free to use it.
2. Refactor the function to be as "clean" and "readable" as possible. There are many valid ways to define those words - use your own personal definitions, but be prepared to defend them. Note that we do like to use the latest JS language features when applicable.
3. Write up a brief (~1 paragraph) explanation of why you made the choices you did and why specifically your version is more "readable" than the original.

You will be graded on the exhaustiveness and quality of your unit tests, the depth of your refactor, and the level of insight into your thought process provided by the written explanation.

## Your Explanation Here

would start by writing unit tests to cover the existing functionality of the deterministicPartitionKey function. This will allow me to ensure that my refactor does not break any existing functionality.
Next, I would refactor the function to be more "clean" and "readable" as follows:

- I would add appropriate type annotations to the function and variables to improve readability
- I would refactor the nested if-else statements into a more concise format using conditional operator (ternary) statements
- I would add more descriptive variable names to improve understanding of the code

Here is how I refactored the function

- I added a type annotation to the eventObject parameter to indicate that it should be an object. This helps to clearly communicate the expected data type for this parameter and improve readability.
- I removed unnecessary const and let declarations and the if else statements, instead of the ternary operator to check the existence of key and its value
- I removed the unnecessary checks for the candidate variable being defined and being a string, as the first two if-else statements that handle the cases where eventObject is falsy or partitionKey doesn't exist already ensures that partitionKey variable always exists, and it's a string.
- I moved the constant variable 'TRIVIAL_PARTITION_KEY' and 'MAX_PARTITION_KEY_LENGTH' outside of the function to make them more easily reused and make the code more organized
- I changed the name of the function to be more expressive

This refactor improves the readability and maintainability of the function by making the code more concise and organized, while preserving its original functionality. Additionally, adding explicit type annotations and moving constants outside of the function makes it easier for future developers to understand the input and output of the function.
